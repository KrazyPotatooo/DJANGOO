Laboratory Final Exam

Create a Django application that implements at least five tables in a database. It should have one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. These field types should be available in your database: date, datetime, char, text, email, image, integer, and decimal. Models should inherit BaseModel, which consists of created_at and updated_at fields. Prepare the __str__ in every model.

You can choose class-based or function-based views. Use Bootstrap as a front-end framework. To implement template inheritance, have separate templates for pagination, footer, and menu.
